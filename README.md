This is my first independent coding project! I want to improve my mental math so that I can work faster in my day-to-day. 

Therefore, I present my numeracy trainer! 
The idea is to go through 10 mental math questions a day and keep track of my progress. The kind of questions I will ask are detailed under the createQuestions() function in the JavaScript file.
